    <h5>To Experience Different Lives/Times/Cultures</h5>
    <p>
      One of the most significant benefits of reading is transporting yourself to different time periods and experiencing different cultures. I often wonder how I would have lived my life during various times and circumstances. Reading improves the imagination.
    </p>
    <h5>To Develop Understanding and Compassion</h5>
    <p>
    Reading enhances compassion for others as we see life from other perspectives.
  </p>
  <h5>To Increase My Knowledge</h5>
  <p>
  I love historical fiction because I am continuing my education. Hazards of reading histfic include falling down Google rabbit holes as I am enticed to research different people, time periods, and events. Reading makes you smarter.
